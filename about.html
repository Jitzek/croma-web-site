                        Hello! My name is Jitze Jan Kerkstra.<br>
                        I am a 2nd year ICT student at NHL Stenden Hogeschool.<br>
                        <br>
                        From idea and design to deployment, I always put in my 100% in every step of the process, I'm driven to make each project my best and want it to be something to be proud of.<br>
                        I've always had a fascination for security, reliability and friendly design and I try to reflect these traits in my own work.<br>
                        When it comes to programming I have a lot of valuable experience in different languages and frameworks and I'm determined to learn more.<br>
                        <br>
                        As one of the main developers working on this site I have taken the opportunity to integrate a good amount of JavaScript into this website.<br>
                        I'm trying to use this opportunity to learn more about automation and styling (mainly animations) using JavaScript.
